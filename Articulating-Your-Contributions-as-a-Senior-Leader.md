# Articulating Your Contributions as a Senior Leader: From Strategy to Personal Innovation

When you work as an individual contributor, all your achievements and accomplishments are easy to talk about — products you built, bugs you solved, designs you developed or the ideas that created a huge impact. You can showcase your value by highlighting the goals and outcomes you achieved independently or how your collaboration enabled a smooth cross-team rollout.

However, this gets tricky as you rise up the ladder and become a leader. You’re no longer writing code, debugging issues or working on architecture design. You are not directly involved in the day-to-day execution of tasks or solving problems on the ground. You set the direction, guide your team and enable them to achieve goals while operating from a 10,000 feet view of your organisation. You set the targets, while others achieve them. You define the strategy, while others execute on it.
