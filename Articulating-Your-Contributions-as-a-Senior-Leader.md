## Articulating Your Contributions as a Senior Leader: From Strategy to Personal Innovation

As an **IC** (individual contributor}, discussing your achievements and contributions feels natural and straightforward—features you shipped, errors you fixed, interfaces you crafted, or concepts that drove significant business value. You can demonstrate your worth by emphasizing the objectives you met through your own efforts or how your partnership with others facilitated a seamless cross-functional delivery.

The landscape becomes far more complex, however, as you climb the ranks and step into leadership. You are no longer committing code, troubleshooting defects, or creating system architectures. You have stepped back from hands-on implementation and frontline problem-solving. Instead, you chart the course, empower your team, and equip them to hit their marks while maintaining a broad, strategic perspective across the organization. You establish the objectives, while your team fulfills them. You craft the roadmap, while your team brings it to life.

### Navigating the Shift in Expectations
With this transition comes a fundamental shift in what is expected of you—not just in performance, but in how you communicate your impact. Stakeholders and senior executives no longer expect you to list technical deliverables; instead, they look for evidence of leverage. They want to see how your vision translated into team-wide velocity, how your deconfliction of roadblocks prevented revenue loss, or how your mentorship built a pipeline of future leaders. The expectation is that your value is now multiplied through others, meaning your articulation must move from "I built" to "I enabled the building of."
